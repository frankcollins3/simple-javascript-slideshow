Practicing Javascript - this is a slideshow 100% pure vanilla Javascript

Demo at: http://practice.stpaultim.com/javascript-slideshow/

This is meant to be a learning project, but happy to share with anyone that finds it useful functionally or more likely as a learning tool. I know that this needs a lot of work to be REALLY useful yet. 

Inspired by a friend who wanted some custom changes to a existing slideshow that were a little unusual. I decided it would be an interesting exercise to try creating an entirely new slideshow with pure vanilla Javascript.
