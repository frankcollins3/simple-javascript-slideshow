    <p>This is a Javascript learning exercise. I wrote this from 
      scratch with pure vanilla Javascript. To see my code and 
      offer feedback/advice. 
      <a href="https://github.com/stpaultim/simple-javascript-slideshow">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>I'm still working on this with a number of additional 
      features planned (as of Jan 2, 2017). Project inspired by the request of a friend.
    </p>
    <p class="left-align">Rough list of planned features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>DONE - Slideshow roughly 600px x 300px.</li>
      <li>Parially Done - Automatic advancement & Manual Controls</li>
      <li>DONE - Caption slides up from bottom (only if there is a caption)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Should look like this:</p>
    <img src="images/slides.png">
  </div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="java.js"></script>
